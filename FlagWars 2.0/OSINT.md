    A small personal site once existed at the domain:
    https://myport-rho-two.vercel.app/
    
    It went offline two years ago.
    But the internet never forgets.
    
    Someone told us the site accidentally exposed a secret in one of its early versions.
    
    **Flag format**: flagwars{...}
    
    No brute-force, no exploitation.
    Just… look into history.
    
    Good luck, archivist.


## Soln:

    Search for the exact link in the web archive to see the saved snapshots
    
    In one of the snapshot->by viewing the source code->you'll get an internal token leaked which is actually b64 encoded (ZmxhZ3dhcnN7eTB1X2ZvdW5kX3RoM19lY2gwX2luX3RoM19hcmNoMXYzfQ==) ->decode it->get the flag

    A mysterious traveler leaves no public profile behind…  
    Except for one image we recovered from their device.
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vL0aOfEIs9ZtGkVK5Ccrkn-KxONiSirb/view?usp=sharing
    
    Somewhere inside this photo lies a clue to their identity.
    
    Once you find it, track their online presence.
    
    When you discover all three accounts, combine the fragments to form the flag.


## Soln:

1. Given a image which clearly is a picture of sherlock-> hints at using sherlock command to find the username across different platforms.
2. To find the username first-> check the metadata of the image (using exiftool or any online metadata viewer)-> it has "cyberwanderer_00x" in author tag
3. Use either google dorking to find different platforms existing for that username or sherlock command in kali
4. P1-> Instagram bio-> P1: flagwars{osint
5. P2-> github status in profile-> p2: _sher
6. P3-> twitter acc (x.com)-> go to profile->replies section->find the comment-> p3:lock_master}

# 4. The Last Match

## Desc:

    >`Author : EnCase`
    
       He was under observation.

    Then he disappeared.

    ***Three years*** have passed. The case is being reopened.

    During a routine archive sweep, a single surveillance image resurfaced — the last confirmed capture of the subject.

    Nothing remarkable at first glance.

    A table. A tablet. A live broadcast playing.

    Investigators believe the broadcast holds the key to determining **when this image was taken.**

    That day is the last time he was ever seen. Can you help them find out the date when he was last seen?

    flag format: flagwars{date}
    eg: {28_02_2026}

## Soln:

    Since it happened 3 years back it means it was 2023. Zooming the picture shows the match is SRH vs KKR.
    Search for the date of the match between SRH and KKR in 2023. 

## Flag:

    flagwars{14_04_2023}
